## About
If you have a disability that prevents you from walking around campus, getting around can be difficult. This is an **Android and iOS** app that helps drivers find, pick up, and transport riders around campus. 
 
The **Rider App** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-rider). The **Dispatcher and Backend Code** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-web).
